# planningAndDesign
I love, LOVE the planning and design stage of the SDLC! I enjoy collating requirements and specifications into a project plan and presenting my approach to the team. I find it thrilling to incorporate stakeholder feedback into plan revisions that improve the scope of the project. I just love all of it!

# Agile Sprints
For my web applications practicum, our class worked with Floop, a local company specializing in teacher/peer to student feedback. My team was tasked with adding pdf download functionality to the UI within the teacher dashboard using React.

# MySQL ERD - "Cookbot"
For this assignemnt, I was tasked with creating a database design for a robot that processes ingredients and cooks meals. Professor Cook said my ERD was one of the best she had ever seen, even asking my permission to use my design as an example for future classes.

# Java UML - Class & Object Diagrams
In my Java II class we were required to create class and object diagrams of each of our major projects.

# Use Case - Dream Wedding
In my project management course we were required to write a project plan and schedule for a large scale event that we moved forward throughout the quarter. I picked a dream wedding, using the agile methodology, in 6 sprints. This was my use case, with relevant stakeholders, created prior to writing the plan/schedule.

# Publishing - Non-software Technical Design
Using the Adobe Design suite, I self-published a 100-page hardback and 125-page digital cookbook. I taught myself InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop to accomplish this ginormous task. What I lacked the skills for, I hired and managed sub-contractors.
