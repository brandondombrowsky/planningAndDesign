# planningAndDesign
I LOVE the planning and design stage of the SDLC! I enjoy collating the requirements and specifications of a project plan and presenting my findings to the team. I find it thrilling to incorporate stakeholder feedback into plan revisions that improve the scope of the project. I just love all of it!
