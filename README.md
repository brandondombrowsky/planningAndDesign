# planningAndDesign
I love, LOVE the planning and design stage of the SDLC! I enjoy collating requirements and specifications into a project plan and presenting my approach to the team. I find it thrilling to incorporate stakeholder feedback into plan revisions that improve the scope of the project. I just love all of it!

# Smartsheet Project Plan for Belidna's Closet
For the first 100-days of the project, I created a Smartsheet project plan to represent not only what we did, but what we accomplished. When the project moved into its next phase, the Technical Project Managers I was supervising expanded upon my work and continubed building a plan to meet our objectives.

# MySQL ERD - "Cookbot"
For this assignemnt, I was tasked with creating a database design for a robot that processes ingredients and cooks meals. Professor Cook said my ERD was one of the best she had ever seen, even asking my permission to use my design as an example for future classes.

# Use Case - Dream Wedding
In my project management course we were required to write a project plan and schedule for a large scale event that we moved forward throughout the quarter. I picked a dream wedding, using the agile methodology, in 6 sprints. This was my use case, with relevant stakeholders, created prior to writing the plan/schedule.

# Publishing - Technical Design
Using the Adobe Design Cloud, I self-published a 100-page hardback and 125-page digital cookbook. I taught myself InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop to accomplish this ginormous task. I also hired and managed sub-contractors.
